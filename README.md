# xamarin-android-tools

**xamarin-android-tools** is a repo to easily share code between the
[xamarin-android][x-a] repo and the Xamarin.Android commercial tooling,
such as IDE extensions, without requiring that the IDE extensions
submodule the entire **xamarin-android** repo, which is gigantic.

# Build Requirements

**xamarin-android-tools** requires Mono 4.8 or later and `nuget`.

# Build Configuration

The default `make all` target accepts the following optional
**make**(1) variables:

  * `$(CONFIGURATION)`: The configuration to build.
    Possible values include `Debug` and `Release`.
    The default value is `Debug`.
  * `$(V)`: Controls build verbosity. When set to a non-zero value,
    The build is built with `/v:diag` logging.

# Build

To build **xamarin-android-tools**, first prepare the project:

	make prepare

This will perform `nuget restore` and any other pre-build tasks
that need to be performed.

Next, run `make`:

	make

# Tests

To run the unit tests:

	make run-all-tests

# Build Output Directory Structure

There are two configurations, `Debug` and `Release`, controlled by the
`$(Configuration)` MSBuild property or the `$(CONFIGURATION)` make variable.

The `bin\$(Configuration)` directory, e.g. `bin\Debug`, contains
*redistributable* artifacts. The `bin\Test$(Configuration)` directory,
e.g. `bin\TestDebug`, contains unit tests and related files.

* `bin\$(Configuration)`: redistributable build artifacts.
* `bin\Test$(Configuration)`: Unit tests and related files.

# Distribution

Xamarin.Android.Tools.AndroidSdk nupkg files are produced for every build which occurrs on [Azure Devops](https://dev.azure.com/xamarin/Xamarin/_build?definitionId=2&_a=summary).
To download one of these packages, navigate to the build you are interested in and click on the `Artifacts` button.

Alternatively, "unofficial" releases are currently hosted on MyGet.
Add the feed to your project's `NuGet.config` to reference these packages:

```xml
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <add
      key="xamarin-android"
      value="https://www.myget.org/F/xamarin-android/api/v3/index.json"/>
  </packageSources>
</configuration>
```
